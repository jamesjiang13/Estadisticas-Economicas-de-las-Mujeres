Estadisticas economicas de las mujeres / Economic statistics of women

This project was inspired by my time living in Latin America combined with the "Ni Una Mas" movement. Women in Latin America face many different obstacles, and I wanted to show that visually using data from the World Bank and D3. While the heart of "Ni Una Mas" started in response to the extreme femicide rate across Latin America, that metric was not available in the World Bank. In its stead, I choose to focus on the socio-economic factors that could possibly contribute to a femicide rate that is one of the highest in the world.
